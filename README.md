# Snake-Game-SFML
The Snake Game is a famous game that a lot of people for sure has played because it was defaultly installed on all phones on the old days. It's a really fun game and even tho it's a simple game its for sure one of the greatest games to play...

I decided to create an replicate of the game by using the SFML library because I always wanted to know the mechanics they use to achieve the movement. It will also be a really fun challenge because I'll be able to learn decent amount of the SFML library.
